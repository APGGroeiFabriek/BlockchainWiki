# TonChain

In the TonChain experiment Ortec Finance, PGGM and APG are working together to create a pension solution on the blockchain. TonChain offers a transparent pension on the blockchain that is immutable, reliable and fair to everyone. The name TonChain originates from the [Tontine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tontine) principle. In TonChain, weâ€™ve taken the Tontine principle and further developed it into a blockchain enabled way of sharing longevity risk peer to peer. 

## Problem being Solved
TonChain has the potential to bring an affordable and reliable pension product to everyone with an internet connection. The rules as defined in the TonChain product are transparent and immutable, so solving issues regarding trust and transparency. TonChain has the potential to bring an affordable and reliable pension product to everyone with an internet connection.

## Why use blockhain (what's the value add over a database?)
The TonChain blockchain application has been developed for the Ethereum blockchain, keeping in mind that it should be possible to run this on a public blockchain. Developing such an application on the public Ethereum blockchain brings many challenges in terms of scalability and maturity of the technology. Using blockchain over a traditional database is important because of blockchains transparent and immutable nature. 

## What blockhain technology are you using (what platforms / fabrics / software) and why ?
As for now TonChain was run on a private blockchain, but we think that in a couple of years the technology will be mature enough to host a fully autonomous pension contract on a public blockchain.

Running TonChain on the public Ethereum blockchain gives it the benefit of being immutable and so solving trust issues whilst being transparent so that every participant in a TonChain pension can know what they are agreeing to.

## What's the ideal end result after your solution is built?
TonChain is a new way of doing pensions and holds the potential of setting a new standard how pensions can be managed. The logic of sharing longevity risk peer to peer has been developed and now we are looking into the future possibilities.
