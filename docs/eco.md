# Eco-System & Sustainability

The philosophy at the basis of Blockchain (Bitcoin) is to support society with an independent system what facilitates the financial infrastructure. Independent of a "corrupted" financial system, independent even of a government's monopoly on creating a currency and their monetary policies around it.

## History

The thought of creating financial government-independent systems (or even money-independent systems)  is not new.

There's a multitude of LETS communities worldwide (_Local Exchange Trading System_). These LETS-circles usually operate based on barter-deals (trading goods-for-goods or goods-for-services).

Difficulties here are:



1.  How to value a good or a service ?
1.  How to bring people together with matching supply/demands ?
1.  How to create equal size inputs for a transaction ?
1.  If this is not possible, how to make sure this disbalance can be transferred through time ?
1.  With a reliable future consumption of the not-yet-consumed credits ?

Netherlands, and especially Amsterdam has a very active community around this (_[noppes](https://www.noppes.nl/npps/index.php)_).  These initiatives have confronted authorities, like the Tax-department , with a challenge, as transactions might not be registered and/or clearly valued.

These initiatives are also available in a more structured form: The [WIR-bank in Switzerland.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIR_Bank) An alternative monetary system set up in 1934  in Switzerland, and actually running with a Bank license since 1936.

The possibilities of Blockchain stretch far beyond crypto-currencies or local barter-deals. What above examples do show is what is needed to organize a complete eco-system in such a way, that the individuals within want and can use this central point-of-truth without one single owner.

## Idealistic vs Commercial

The commercial winner of  competing companies usually lies with 1<sup>st</sup> one to get to market, the 1<sup>st</sup> one to get to a critical market-volume…. It's always been a winner-takes-all game.

Blockchain-technology might tip over this scale…  It originates from a hacking-community, whereby the governance-is-designed-and-operated by the masses – not the odd individual superpower-company. Blockchain is about inclusiveness.

The elements what make a difference.

## Only works with Eco-system cooperation

A blockchain only delivers it's full potential when it's being used by a significant part of an eco-system (the eco-system being defined as a the parties, processes, assets, transactions, roles & responsibilities, governance-system and data combined constituting one value chain).

For a system to be adopted to an entire eco-system,  for every stakeholder the advantages need to exceed the disadvantages. And this is quite a challenge.

It cannot be developed and implemented by 1 company (although what can be seen at this moment is that industry-leading enterprises take the lead in blockchain-developments and try to onboard surrounding/supplying companies); it requires a buy-in from all… at least a large part of an eco-system; which requires a balance in the functional and technical requirements on which the system is build.

## Redefinition of industries & business processes

As this technology could redefine and convert the roles and responsibilities in industry value-chains, within companies and business processes, it requires a group of open-minded people with a lot of confidence in their added value in the chain to explore and lead blockchain-developments within their eco-system.

To be able to operationalize this blockchain, business processes need to be defined razor sharp, be well structured, and modulized/commoditized. With these new business process-modules, it will be very easy to compare effectivity/efficiency between companies, but also to insource/outsource processes or sub-processes. It has the potential to make both operations and financials very transparent – which has proven in history that costs go down and services are easier accessable (think of the rise and fall of the Telecom-industry).

## Sustainability

Sustainability  describes how an eco-system can function in a long term and stable manner. Typically the pillars being defined are "society", "economy", "ecology". 

Above mentioned  dynamics can prove a good fundament for a well-balanced society, supporting the needs of all stakeholders. A well-balanced system like this will proof to generate the most stable economy: An acceptable and comfortable situation has always proven the biggest enemy of people trying to start a revolution.

On an ecological level there are still some hurdles to take though.

*   The consensus-mechanism "Proof-of-Work "(Mining)  takes a huge electrical charge, what will need to change into a less wasteful process. The techniques are available, to change this in a running blokchain though will require some significant efforts.
*   The ever increasing data-lake stored in running blockchains. A blockchain in principle does not delete any records. This accumulates to a lot of data (stored on more and more nodes). Also search-processes within these high number of records will take more and more time (and thus also electricity).
