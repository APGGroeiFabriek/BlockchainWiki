## In a Nutshell

Traditionally, when you want to use an internet service, you connect to a server run by a company. This server maintains the databse of information that you can access by downloading the app. All decisions relating how to manipulate the database, such as adding records, editing information, or deleting content is made by the company running the server. It is their responsibility to ensure the server represents the genuine truth.

Let's take the example of paypal:
1.  You wish to send money to a friend using paypal
2.  You signup on paypal.com, which paypal will approve and add you to their servers.
3.  You deposit money to paypal's bank account, and then they will add a transaction on their database showing your new balance. This balance is simply credit that paypal owes you.
4.  You send money to your friend using paypal. Paypal makes a new record on their database which debits your balance and credits your friend's wallet.

Then the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, came up with an astounding innovation: a ledger that doesn't require a central server or authority to maintain it.

While rudimentary, the bitcoin blockchain is equivalent to multiple computers running the same excel file at the same time, now the important decisions about how to manipulate the database could be done as a group.
