<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/253774398" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

We create and support a low-cost, flexible and reliable Pension Infrastructure so that pension service providers are able to deliver maximum value for the pension funds and their participants.

## Problem 
Pension administration flexibility, cost per participant and transparence.

## Why use Blockchain?
The DNA of blockchain with transaction audit trail and ecosystem focus matches the DNA of pension administration as a system of record where information on the pension history needs to be kept safe for a very long time.

## Accomplishments
Starting in late 2015 we have produced multiple PoCâ€™s and showcases to build support and show how blockchain can deliver on its promises to become the future of pensions.

## What Success Looks Like
That PI will be used for the pension administration of everybody in the Netherlands.

## Technology Used
We have tried multiple but found that a lot of current solutions not yet meet enterprise standard. Currently weâ€™re investigating which set of software modules fits best with current IT standards for pension administration and only after weâ€™re convinced that we found the right set up we will start building the Pension Infrastructure of the Future again.

## Problems when Using Blockchain
None ðŸ˜œ 

Inexplicable bugs, no floating point integers available, network instability, smart contract incompatibility, no support from software vendors. But we overcame all of them.
