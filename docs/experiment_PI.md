# Pension Infrastructure (PI)

We create and support a low-cost, flexible and reliable Pension Infrastructure so that pension service providers are able to deliver maximum value for the pension funds and their participants.

**Problem being Solved**:  
What Pension administration flexibility, cost per participant and transparence.

**Why use the Blockhain (what's the value add over a database?)**:
The DNA of blockchain with transaction audit trail and ecosystem focus matches the DNA of pension administration as a system of record where information on the pension history needs to be kept safe for a very long time.

**What has your experiment accomplished/built so far?**:
Starting in late 2015 we have produced multiple PoCâ€™s and showcases to build support and show how blockchain can deliver on its promises to become the future of pensions.

**What's the ideal end result after your solution is built?**:
That PI will be used for the pension administration of everybody in the Netherlands.

**What Blockhain technology are you using (what platforms / fabrics / software) and why ?**:
We have tried multiple but found that a lot of current solutions not yet meet enterprise standard. Currently weâ€™re investigating which set of software modules fits best with current IT standards for pension administration and only after weâ€™re convinced that we found the right set up we will start building the Pension Infrastructure of the Future again.

**Issues arisen from using blockchain**:
None ðŸ˜œ 

Inexplicable bugs, no floating point integers available, network instability, smart contract incompatibility, no support from software vendors. But we overcame all of them.

**Where could you use help / ideas from APG community?**:
Bringing blockchain to real life implementation and help us to deliver maximum customer value and validate the solutions we design.
