# RetireMe

 RetireMe is an awareness platform which provides consumers with means to save up for their retirement. The platform facilitates saving through micro transactions based on sustainable use cases, for example deposit bottle returns. Our goal is to make consumers aware to the point that they understand the potential return on investment regarding long term investments. RetireMe also aims to provide consumers with accessible ways of contributing financially to their pensions. Adding use cases to the platform will account for multiple awareness touch points, adding up to higher monthly investments with even greater returns on investments.

 

## Problem
Consumers think their pensions are taken care of and are not making arrangements to have an aditional retirement fund for extra financial freedom. 

RetireMe is solving this problem by making consumers aware of retirement investment efficiency and makes saving for additional retirement funds accessible.

## Why use Blockchain?
We need a scalable solution developing an agile platform that caters to a growing amount of users, use cases and pension investment opportunities. The compliance from multiple governing bodies demand safe and easy auditability as well as transparency towards regulators. These needs are met by an immutable redundantly synced record on multiple nodes containing all records ever created through the platform. Blockchain assures fast transactions, easy maintenance, stability and constant accessibility.

 

## Current Progress
The experiment is still in the exploring phase. Throughout the course of the blockchain hackathon a working prototype has been developed. The idea and proof of concept won the 2018 Pension track of the Blockchaingers Hackathon and the 2018 ICTalent awards. 

 

## What Success Looks Like
An independent platform for all consumers to save up for additional retirement funds with a low threshold from microtransaction of sustainable use cases. This platform provides freedom of choice in financial products for additional retirement funds. The goal is that retirement funds will cover for the lifestyle consumers realistically aim to have when they want to retire.

## Technology Used
We are currently researching which blockchain or distributed ledger technology is the best option to develop RetireMe to its full potential. We have built a working prototype on Ethereum (Rinkerby testnet) with Solidity, NodeJS and Java.

## Request for Help
?> Currently we are looking for connections with different supermarkets in the Netherlands for the first deposit bottle use case. If you think you have or know a use case that is perfect for the platform we are building, please contact us. Furthermore we believe that user experience is incredibly important for the success of the platform, so ideas in that area would be incredibly helpful as well.<br><br>For all other additions or ideas come in contact with the team!
