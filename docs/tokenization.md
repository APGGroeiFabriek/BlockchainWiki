# Tokenization

Author: André Zandee
Date:	23 Aug 2018 


## Introduction
To start with the theoretical high-over:



*   A token is a **_uniquely identifiable reference_**, which either **_is_** or **_represents_** something (product, service) of **_value_**. Within the context of this paper, this is blockchain-registered.
*   What exactly it is (the role, the purpose, the underlying value) needs to be explained, though. This description needs to be SMART and consistent, within itself, within its context and within time. 
*   This definition and its implications also needs to be accepted by the community using it.
*   How it is being registered technically determines possibilities and limitations in its usage.
*   Above items and the way it is being presented influence also the legal status. 

Some practical examples:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Asset representation:</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Used as:</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>A kWh of energy coming from a solar panel
<p>
A trip by car over a certain distance
<p>
An insurance policy
<p>
A participation in a crowdfund
<p>
A currency, either virtual or formally backed by a government (fiat)
<p>
A music MP3
   </td>
   <td>Software license

<p>
Bond issuance
<p>
Project contribution
<p>
Access to software application

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Now we'll dive a bit deeper into the theoretical classifications, which hopefully helps in getting more grip on why it's there, what it does and why it is expected to have a big impact on the world. We'll start with the business side:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>Utility</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Owner token
   </td>
   <td>A token that represents the ownership of a physical/digital product/service.
<p>
Examples: BTC (Bitcoin)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Usage tokens
   </td>
   <td>A token that provides access to a digital service, similar to a paid API key
<p>
Examples: STX (Stacks, Blockstacks)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Work tokens
   </td>
   <td>A token that provides the right to contribute to a system, and provides the owner the right to contribute incentivized by a reward-system or get utility from the system itself.
<p>
Examples: REP (Reputation, Augur)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Hybrid tokens

On the technical side, the following classification if often used:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>Technical layer</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Blockchain native tokens
   </td>
   <td>A token that is implemented on the protocol-level of a blockchain

Examples: BTC (Bitcoin), ETH (Ether, Ethereum)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Non-native protocol tokens

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>(d)App tokens
   </td>
   <td>A token that is implemented on the application-level on top of a blockchain (and potentially protocol).
<p>
Examples: WIZ (Wisdom, Gnosis)

The legal impact of all of this is often classified into the following categories:

  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>Legal status</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Utility tokens

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Security tokens
   </td>
   <td>A token that behaves like a security
<p>
Examples: SPICE (SPICE VC), Bitwaia (tba)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Cryptocurrency tokens
   </td>
   <td>A token that is a pure cryptocurrency / used for payment services and value storage
<p>
Examples: BTC (Bitcoin), ZEC (ZCash)
   </td>
  </tr>

**Strategic Level**

The internet was the base source of the digital world, where information could be freely shared. Key protocols, such as TCP/IP and HTTP, made it possible to move freely within this dimension. The lack of physical presence, verification-process of who you're dealing with and time-lack + separation between delivery of goods/services and the payment for these, were obstructions in the commercial development.

Blockchain brings the possibility to overcome these things – with tokens playing a significant role in this.

**Tokens representing value**

What is defined as valuable, can be very diverse. 



1.  Money and assets are the most obvious ones. 
1.  The rights to accumulate them can be a secondary one, 
1.  and the possibility to influence or make decisions can be also a very powerful functionality.
1.  **Money and Assets**

The whole Blockchain-movement started with crypto-currencies (read: Bitcoin), providing a new way of storing, transporting and exchanging money. No need for a bank granting you access to a savings-account, marginal costs of transferring your money to far-away family. 

The down-side is the highly fluctuating value of these crypto-currencies – inspiring some companies to grab back to old principles – such as the gold-standard.


```


```


Besides value-carrying tokens, in crypto-land, we also distinguish "utility-tokens" (defined as a facilitator to do transactions, not as a value-carrier). Theoretical this might seem easy to grasp as a clear distinction, but when you realize that since 1971 the USD-value link to Gold was abandoned, there's nothing more than the trustworthiness of a government backing the value of i.e. the USD. Policies like "Quantitative Easing" have put pressure on this trust for some, triggering a longing back to more fixed and predictable monetary structure (which strangely enough the foundations of crypto-currencies provide with a predefined amount of tokens). 

An example


```
A bitcoin is a native token on the Bitcoin-blockchain, and used / defined as a true crypto currency. There's no real-assets or fiat-currencies (name for traditional country-governed currencies) backing the value of this. The value is purely defined by supply and demand. As the supply is pre-defined in a smart contract (max # bitcoins possible is 21 million).
```


As most countries state a Bank-license is required for creating a currency, most platforms claim to generate utility-token. Probably in the close future, clear definitions of what's what will materialize.

When talking transactions, what really matters is the assets. When you think of a real digital assets (i.e. [music mp3's)](http://rightsshare.com/?p=206) it is easy to link them to a token. But the majority of assets is physical. When you want to trade these on a Blockchain, somehow a solid link needs to be created between this asset and the blockchain-transaction. This could be done through RFID-type solutions, or through geographical coordinates for [real-estate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/02/07/the-first-government-to-secure-land-titles-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-expands-project/#69860e6e4dcd). Thinking more out of the box you could redefine real assets as services (i.e. selling the usage instead of the ownership). One of the best known out-of-the-box blockchain test-projects for trading non-fungible assets is the [crypto-kitties project.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptokitties)

Looking at APG's core-business, it makes sense to distinguish between liquid and illiquid assets. Liquid assets are usually represented by some sort of certificates. The link with Blockchain is not difficult to imagine when these certificates would not be printed, but created as [smart-contract defined tokens](https://www.daimler.com/investors/refinancing/blockchain.html).

Illiquid assets, not as well-structured as liquids, might be slightly more difficult to convert to a token-based solution, but think of the new possibilities in the context of securitization and creating secondary market liquidity when successful. 

APG-AM Operations has supported a Groeifabriek-project, BLIEP, focusing specifically on this topic. In the next newsletter more on this.

**Atomic SWAP: Solving time-lack and interlink asset-transfer and payment**

To solve the counterparty-risk during a transaction, caused by the lack of interlink between asset delivery and payment and/or the time-difference between transaction and settlement, tokens can provide the possibility of "equal value, equal time transfer". As the asset-representing token and payment-representing token are actually inside the transaction, parties can be fully sure there is no way someone can cheat here.


```

```


**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Conclusions of "Tokens" as money or assets:</span>_**



*   Creates a link between the blockchain and trade-able / storable assets of value
*   Creates the possibility to redefine assets as we know them, creating  new secondary markets and liquidity.
*   Supports creating transparency, immutable and indefinite storage of ownership and transaction-logs.
1.  **Tokens as rights to earn assets**

Tokens provide a new way of providing incentives for the creation of protocols and for governing their evolution.

A for profit company can now create a new protocol and create value for itself (and its investors) by retaining some of the tokens. If the protocol becomes widely used, the value of the tokens will increase. For instance, think of a decentralized storage service (a la Amazon's S3). Anyone can implement the storage protocol in whatever language they want to as long as they meet the protocol spec. They can then get paid in the relevant storage tokens. The original creator of the protocol will make money to the extent that it is adopted and to the degree they have retained some of the tokens (so they can sell them at a higher price later on). This is not hypothetical as there are a variety of such protocols out there, including Storj, SIA and Filecoin.

This is a radical change to the past. Historically the only way to make money from a protocol was to create software that implemented it and then try to sell this software (or to host it). Since the creation of this software (e.g. web server/browser) is a separate act many of the researchers who have created some of the most successful protocols in use today have had little direct financial gain. With tokens, however, the creators of a protocol can "monetize" it directly and will in fact benefit more as others build businesses on top of that protocol.

This makes a lot of resources available  to include into protocol innovation. That would be great as we have many missing protocols to make a decentralized data world work well. There is also a natural rate limit on how much of the wealth can be retained. Because the protocol is public (by definition) if a creator tries to retain too many tokens there is an incentive for everyone else to replicate the protocol with a new token none of which is retained.

Conclusions of "tokens as right to earn assets"



1.  **Influencing and decision making**

Tokens can also be used to define and operationalize Governance-processes. One can think of utilizations like script-defined manifests and voting-/decision-making applications.  Tokens provide the possibility to bring voting- and decision-making straight back to the person who owns these rights. In most instances the need to centrally delegate this to another person was born out of time- and costs-constraints.

What's important here, is that this influencing and decision making power should not be owned by 1 organization / person / interest, but should be based on inclusion of all applicable stakeholders. As an example, please look at examples like Uber (whereby a driver's right to earn money is quite a one-sided decision, framed in an automated process).

For governance details, I would like to refer to the chapter "Governance".

**Token buyers will be to investors what bloggers/tweeters are to journalists**

Tokens will break down the barrier between professional investors and token buyers in the same way that the internet brought down the barrier between professional journalists and tweeters and bloggers.

This will have several implications:

•The internet allowed anyone to become an amateur journalist. Now, millions of people will become amateur investors.

•As with journalism, some of these amateurs will do extremely well, and will use their token-buying track-record to break into professional leagues.

•Just like it eventually became a professional requirement for journalists to use Twitter, investors of every size from seed funds to hedge funds will get into token buying.

•New tools analogous to Blogger and Twitter will be developed that make it easy for people to use, buy, sell, and discuss tokens with others.

**Technical**

There are several types of token-protocol available; each one with its specific functionalities. Which token-protocol is available, depends on the fabric, programmability of the fabric and which layer it is defined.

As we saw above, there's 3 types of technical classifications:



*   Blockchain native tokens (implemented on the protocol-level of a blockchain itself - Examples: BTC (Bitcoin), ETH (Ether, Ethereum)
*   Non-native protocol tokens (implemented in a crypto-economic protocol on top of a blockchain. Examples: REP (Decentralized Oracle Protocol, Augur)
*   (d)App tokens (implemented on the application-level on top of a blockchain (and potentially protocol). Examples: WIZ (Wisdom, Gnosis)

Below we'll discuss some successful examples.

Having a standard token-protocol (like ERC20 is for Ethereum) has a lot of benefits:



*   Uniformity of tech and protocol standard.
*   Reduced complexity of understanding each type of token implementation.
*   Enhanced liquidity of ERC20 tokens.
*   Reduced risk of breaking contracts.

Imagine a scenario wherein every token on Ethereum's network has got its own set of standard and rules. This will create a liquidity problem for such tokens and a lot of headache for exchanges that try to implement them. In this scenario, each time a token comes for listing to an exchange, it would require a lot of work from bottom to top to be actually listed.

Whereas, if you have a standard and uniformity, it becomes very easy for users as well as exchanges to list such tokens quickly given that the tokens follow a standard.

Current difficulty is that the technology of tokens has still got bugs. In this sense standardization and bringing the token-technology to a full-grown level are slowing each other down. ERC20 is currently the most used one, but is certainly not perfect, and by far not the only one available, so… if you want to know more on other Ethereum token protocol standards: [Click here](https://www.cointelligence.com/content/comparison-erc20-erc223-new-ethereum-erc777-token-standard/).

**Legal Status**

Tokens are used for a multitude of purposes, certainly not in the least as a financial tool to get funding for projects and companies.

Most countries have got a strict legislation around 



1.  setting up of a new currency, 
1.  the creation and selling of securities and 
1.  holding liquidity and assets on behalf of others.

Very important here in the setup of tokens is to comply with both local legislation, legal principals and norms/values, but also within the countries where the tokens should become available.

Some logical questions in this situation would be: 



1.  What is the used definition of a currency or a security ?
    1.  Is this linked to the functional characteristics of the token at hand or
    1.  Is this defined by the behavior of the party who created and tries to bring it to market ?
1.  What do the legislator and authorities allow to be done by non-licensed parties ?

When you want to start using tokens, and they could be used as a representative of financial value, make sure you've got sufficient legal council.
