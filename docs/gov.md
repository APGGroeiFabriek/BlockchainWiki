# Governance

## Theory
Governance is the processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, a market or a
network, over a social system (family, tribe, formal or informal organization, a territory or across
territories) and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an organized society.
interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem . Governance is
the way the rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held accountable.

Blockchain is a distributed ledger-system, used as the single source of truth and governed by the
eco-system which uses it.

Instead of having to meet the requirements of just the one company where it is installed in (as is the
case for traditional databases), blockchain needs to meet the requirements of this complete eco-
system ‚Äì having to bridge all gaps in perception and expectation associated with the different
activities, goals and roles in the supply- and value-chain.

To keep an overview, the most blockchain-relevant types of governance are highlighted here:

| Type of Governance 	| Relevant Questions 	|
|--------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| **Corporate** 	| Is there an independent legal entity set up to govern, administer ?Is there a clear governance- and decision-process set up around the Blockchain?<br>Is there a Risk, Control & Compliancy system set up?<br>Is there a clear party onboarding / offboarding process ? 	|
| **Legal** 	| Which laws apply to the the Blockchain? (geo / industry / functional (data, privacy, tax, etc)<br>How to comply to these laws?<br>Is there a solid KYC-process required? 	|
| **IT** 	| Who owns the IT-infrastructure?<br>Is there a Blockchain monitoring system set up?<br>Are there minimal threshold-levels for Blockchain-configuration and ‚Äìperformance?<br> Are there clear SLA agreements?<br>What Incident-process is set up ?What Change-process is set up?<br> What if a party disagrees / cannot comply ?Is there a clear node / smart contract onboarding / offboarding process ? 	|
| **Data** 	| Who owns the data?<br> What does the data mean?<br> Who is the data-processor?<br> Is there a need for processing the data? 	|

## Experiment

A high level of trust, professionalism and a constructive approach are required to engage into setting up a Blockchain. As the reduced control over the governance-outcomes in combination with the necessity to work with potential competitors as partners creates a vacuum where previously competitive thresholds kept an artificial power in balance. A very clear view of and believe in the worth of the added value of you and your organization are needed for this as well.

APG GroeiFabriek is a trend-setter in creating the landscape and eco-system for the blockchain-based pension services infrastructure in Netherlands.

APG participates in the experiment ‚ÄúTechruption Blockchain Consortium‚Äù. 
Target of this experiment is to learn which additional technical, operational and governmental challenges show up when a Blockchain-platform is set up within the context of a consortium.

APG‚Äôs experiment ‚ÄúPI‚Äù partially focuses on the Legal Governance topic. The main reason for this is that Blockchain-technology has got a tensioned relationship with the new GDPR legislation. Especially principles such as ‚Äúthe right to be forgotten‚Äù, ‚Äúdata transportability‚Äù and the legal restrictions around functional requirements to process data.

## Technology
A smooth governance of a blockchain platform within the context of a consortium requires a lot of supporting tools. Some examples:

* proposal system  (handling & storage of votes and proposals)
* voting or rule system (which defines contextual conditions)
* membership system (which the voting system looks to for its conditional logic)
* delegation system (which allows the delegation of votes to other members)
* family or subcommittee system (which allows the registration of organizational structure)
* change-& release management system
* IT-performance  & SLA monitoring and processing system
* compliance system (to monitor and report on legal and regulatory compliance)

At this moment there‚Äôs not a lot out there which are able to support a blockchain-system, let alone one within a consortium-context. Particularly strange as there‚Äôs  a lot of eyes focused on DAO-like cooperations, whereby the assumption is that management is obsolete and governance is democratized in an automated way.

There are however a couple of solutions in development-state.
