# Net.js

The target of this experiment is to develop, build and operationalize the pension infrastructure for the net DC-solution APG provides.

In normal language: Pensions are capped at an income of approx. EUR 105,000 / year. If people have got a higher salary, they’ve got the possibility to partipate in this pension-extension program.

## Problem being solved
This administrative process needs to fit within the overall pension administration which APG runs. The PI-project (described as separate experiment) takes care of the base-pension administration infrastructure. This is a separate module.

The essence of the issue being tackled is to create an efficient, transparent and compliant pension infrastructure, which meets the requirements of the pension participant in functionalities, flexibility and costs.

## Why use the Blockhain (what's the value add over a database?)
The financial world is changing – quick. Blockchain provides the best basis to automate business processes, where control, trust, risk and control play a key role.

## Progress So Far
A working proto-type on a pension infrastructure for this net pension-solution, covering several possible events within the life of a pension participant.

## What Success Looks Like
A minimal costs Straight-Through-Processing pension process infrastructure, what delivers the required functionalities, flexibility for all stakeholders to take a big step into the future.

## Technology Used
In the experiment phase Ganache was used to simulated a private Ethereum blockchain. Web3 was used to interact with the blockchain. A front-end was created that was able to interact with the blockchain using Node.js, Express and Web3. Future development of this project might be done using different software.

The base of this is founded on Ethereum.

## Problems you've faced when using blockchain?
We’ve had some challenges debugging the code when writing blockchain applications. There were also some challenges related to exception and error handling. Also scalability becomes less as more complex computations are done on the blockchain.

## Where could you use help / ideas from APG community ?
?> Guess this could be an open invitation for APG’ers to help us/contribute wherever they see fit! Something similar as with TonChain?
