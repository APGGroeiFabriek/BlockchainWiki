# Techruption Blockchain Consortium
 
APG GroeiFabriek participates in the experiment “Techruption Blockchain Consortium”.

We’ve got a 3 fold knowledge accumulation target with this

1. Technical knowledge on the setup of a private blockchain”
2. Governance knowledge and experience on checks-and-balances, and decision processes around parties, nodes and smart contracts on a private blockchain, managed within a consortium.
	* Governance here is defined as Corporate, Legal, IT, Operational and Data Governance.
3. Operational knowledge and experience on key monitoring metrics, and required actions to have a smooth Business As Usual, Change and On/Offboarding process.

 
## The Problem

The traditional Software-solutions only had to meet technical and functional requirements of their own company, making sure change did not intervene with *Business As Usual* performance.

Blockchain technology needs to comply with this, but in addition presents a bundle of new challenges:

* A large part of an eco-system has to adopt this technology to be the single-point-of-truth for it to deliver optimal added value
* All these (usually very diverse) stakeholders need to be able to work well with it and have their requirements met
* These stakeholders (think: competitors, regulators, services providers) need to cooperate effectively with each other to govern this shared single-source-of-truth

 

## The Added Value

The reward for a functioning Blockchain infrastructure though, is big. Blockchain can simplify processes and make them more transparent, it can convert business principles and manual processes into smart contract-logic – in essence dissolve numerous forms of counterparty-risks.

But as said before: To have a long term sustainable system, what works well for all, the governance needs to function well.

## Accomplishments and Targets

So far the experiment Techruption Blockchain Consortium has delivered

1. A high level technical structure / configuration for a functioning private blockchain

2. A base setup for and important topics of a relevant governance model for a blockchain-solution within the context of a consortium

3. An initial overview of operational topics needing to be adressed.

APG’s target to accomplish is to develop a complete roadmap towards an inclusive pension services eco-system, build on blockchain-technology and generating as much added value towards each of the stakeholders, pension-participant on number 1, as possible.


## Technology Used / Fabric

The fabric the TBC has been using so far is [**QUORUM**](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum). It is one of the view fabrics which promiss to have a GDPR-compliant solution concerning data-processing (GDPR-statement: To process privacy-sensitive data, an entity needs to have a relevant reason).

The goal of the TBC is to have a multi-fabric platform, whereby a smart contract-user can switch between fabrics.

 
## Our Problems when using Blockchain

To get through company firewalls proves to be a significant issue. In the basis: This is what firewalls are for, but for Blockchain-technology there needs to be found a more structural solution for this.

Also QUORUM v2.0 did not prove as stable as hoped for – at least not in the context we would like it to be.

 

## Our Request for Help

Good input for technical and governance base-structures is always welcome – especially within a consortium and/or private blockchain context. Operational experience with private blockchain-solutions is also quite essential for going forward quickly.
