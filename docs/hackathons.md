## What's a Hackathon?

A hackathon is a competition, usually 24-48 hours, where indviduals think of a problem and build an application to solve it. At the end of the competition, each team presents their solution in front of their peers and experts. The winner walks away with money and potentially starts a new company.

APG has sponsored the largest [blockchain hackathons](https://blockchaingers.org/) in the Netherlands. We want to work with and empower the visionaries and builders who want to build the future of pensions.

## What's the Future of Pensions?

The future of work is evolving. No longer does an individual collect a pension by working for a single employer. Instead, people switch careers and jobs much more often, collecting benefits from multiple plans and companies. In addition, self-employment and entrepreneurial spirit is rising, which demands customized pension solutions for this new class of worker and their working arrangements.

Pensions have always been about creating life-security for its customers. Pension funds are characterized by big numbers (millions of participants), lots of money (hundreds of billions in assets) and lots of transactions (hundreds of thousands per day). Yet, most important is the long term relationship that a pension fund has with each of its participants. Developments in the market bring up new challenges for pension providers to maintain this responsibility by finding new customized solutions that match the needs of changing lifestyles and careers. Blockchain, being an immutable ledger, might offer a trusted base for new, more personal services.

   <td>Raise awareness among young people and build trust in pension systems through transparency using blockchain technology. They aim to use blockchain to create a system where people could for example recycle their old electronic devices and add the money to their pensions. This requires the involvement of partners, such as supermarkets and recycling centers. Ultimately their solution would make young people start saving younger, which is important because the population is getting older.

The value of money would be measured not by work (usually mining and transactions in cryptocurrency), but by staking your Ehthereum. The final impact of the product, according to Carl Cranker, "allows for a company to invest funds and insure in return, in digital infrastructure".

Using blockchain, the team will create an ecosystem where different parties such as pension funds, companies, and workers can be implemented and use smart contracts to minimize administration costs. The innovation would allow flexibility and choice for users, and release the money that is currently locked up in pension funds, to be used in a sustainable way.

According to Adri Wischmann, the key management tool could be used in case of death but also whenever a key is lost for any reason. This would be done by splitting the key up in parts and distributing it to a group of beneficiaries. After a certain time of inactivity, the key could be recovered with assurance from for example 80% of the beneficiaries. Wischmann says the tool would fix the biggest pain in the blockchain world by assuring that keys would not get lost anymore.

They want to apply blockchain to keep free-moving individual workers linked to APG while they are working across the globe, and to create a linking mechanism that allows for more mobility for workers without complications related to taxes and legal issues. ATMA wants to come up with ideas that can be implemented quickly and build a better future in small practical steps.
