# Blockchain – The Story

_Edited by André Zandee_

_Created 6 Sept 2018_

The story begins halfway the 20<sup>th</sup> century, but really catches on in 2008, 3 months after the Bank-crisis starts: Bitcoin is born. Let's start from there.

## The Big Picture

[Bitcoin was set up](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) to prove society is not dependent on an ill-balanced banking-system, people are empowered to regulate their own financials without a government what uses policy-instruments like [quantitative easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing). It is a crypto-currency, intended to provide an alternative to fiat-currencies (government regulated and managed money).

The bigger picture here is that new technology brings new opportunities for everyone. 

Internet brought the free and abundant access to information to anyone – whereas before people were limited to the local library, and a handful of other paid resources. It also provides a digital connection-layer, bringing people together in totally new ways. It is the infrastructure where all apps and internet-services provide their services:



*   Google brought an oracle to any question, 
*   Siri brings a personal assistant, 
*   Uber brings logistics-on-demand
*   Social media took partly over the role of journalism and professional media
*   The smart phone and Flickr overtook partly the role of professional photographers, etc, etc.

Blockchain promises to be the next big wave. It can bring a digital infrastructure which 



*   facilitates trusted transactions between parties who do not necessarily know or trust each other
*   It can restructure and even re-define industries and business processes, catalyzed by
    *   Firmly structuring business processes
    *   Converting manual checks & balances by technically automated ones
    *   Create a modular structure (commoditizing)  and combine the functionalities
    *   Automate this
        *   Resulting in a potentially very low-cost delivery of services
        *   Example: The [D(ecentralized) A(utonomous) O(rganization)](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentrale_autonome_organisatie)

But more on this further into this wiki.

Blockchain consists of several technologies which are not necessary new, but brought together in a very smart way, re-inforcing each other's qualities.

## Building Blocks


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Technology</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Origins</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Peer-to-peer Ledger technology
   </td>
   <td>Beginning to the 21<sup>st</sup> century, peer to peer technology really took off with Napster and Skype. It provides a smart way of creating together a technical infrastructure (supporting bandwidth, storage and sharing of files)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="http://wiki.groeifabriek.com/#/crypto">Cryptography</a>
   </td>
   <td>In the Roman times already techniques were known to encrypt texts, during the 2<sup>nd</sup> WW even a Cypher-machine was build to automate this. In the 70s groups were busy to protect their privacy through encryption-methods (<a href="https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/nakamotoinstitute.org/blob/master/sni/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt">Cypher punk-manifesto</a>) and the current digital world screams more and more for ways to protect an individuals privacy, and ways to make sure only you can decide about your assets and be sure you know with whom you're dealing.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Hashing
   </td>
   <td>A hash is a standard database function, providing a simple way to verify that a (communication/storage) process does not affect the content (input = output). For blockchain it supports the transaction commitment-process, but also secures blocks are secured and sequential structure integrity is guaranteed.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="http://wiki.groeifabriek.com/#/consensus">Consensus mechanism</a> (new ways of committing records to the "database")
   </td>
   <td>When dealing with a party you do not know or trust, one needs a secure way to make sure a transaction you commit to really delivers what is promised and the other party cannot manipulate with the transaction, or halfway run off with the goods. 
<p>
There are multiple consensus principles according to which a blockchain can work. Very energy-intensive ones, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW / example: Bitcoin) fully outsource the validation-process to a 3<sup>rd</sup> party (miner), but are not ecological friendly. There are many, many other mechanisms, each one with different qualities and pitfalls.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Smart contracts
   </td>
   <td>Smart contracts are scripts, stored in Blockchain-records, and linking together, provide a software infrastructure supporting blockchain-usage within apps, companies, etc.
<p>
Some base protocols cover the functionalities of wallets, tokens (representing i.e. crypto-currencies). 
<p>
A lot of them are based on Ethereum (providing so far the most extensive fabric-functionalities). 
<p>
A lot is open source, with a big community sharing their scripts through i.e. <a href="https://github.com/">Github.</a>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="http://wiki.groeifabriek.com/#/tokenization">Tokens</a>
   </td>
   <td>A token is a computerized reference to something or someone. In blockchain this is usually used as something or a placeholder for something of value. It is the basis for a crypto-currency, but there are many other ways to use this.
   </td>
  </tr>

## Features Enabled

The combination of above mentioned blockchain-technological ingredients, provide a technical foundation for a set of programmable base principles . 


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Base principles</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Immutability
   </td>
   <td>once data has been written to a blockchain no one, not even a system administrator, can change it. 
<p>
This provides benefits for audit.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The majority decides
   </td>
   <td>Depending on how the consensus-mechanism is organized, but the base idea behind this is that the collective needs to decide on whether or not a node functions as expected, a block is added to the chain and a transaction is valid or not.
<p>
The bigger and the more diversified (fragmented) the collective, the more secure is the total.
<p>
When a limited amount of nodes or highly clustered mining-groups, a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp">51% hack</a> becomes more likely.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Full transparency
   </td>
   <td>Everything what is registered in the blockchain, is visible to the people who can access it (public blockchain this means everyone, private blockchain this is the people being able to access a node).
<p>
Example: <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Programmable privacy
   </td>
   <td>Encryption- and hashing-techniques create programmable privacy-boundaries. Same goes for functionalities i.e. <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> delivers.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Non copy-able (double-spend-issue)
   </td>
   <td>Digital content can easily be copied. What makes a blockchain unique, is that a token can only be moved, not copied. This is a necessary feature to prove who owns a token, and also makes sure no one can fake passing on a token or start creating their own new tokens.
   </td>
  </tr>

## APG's Blockchain Journey

[Download our slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7rbxUFehbJGZkhFM1RNQ292eG0xWWk3WV9iZGpjdzUzcUJV/view?usp=sharing)

These base principles are then translatable into functional features which are the foundation for the potentially disruptive blockchain business solutions.

This wiki is set up in such a way that it sequentially zooms in on relevant topics of Blockchain – both

*   the technical and governance building blocks, 
*   the features and qualities it brings
*   the required changes in thinking and business approach it requires

It does this in the following structure:

*   Business focus
*   Technical focus
*   APG GroeiFabriek experiments outcomes

This provides in our view the best way to understand the why, how and what Blockchain is and can deliver, both in business- and technical respect..

The APG GroeiFabriek Blockchain team wishes you a good journey through our wiki.
