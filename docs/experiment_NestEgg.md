**Invest in your basic needs by crowdfunding the future infrastructure of your community.**

**The future is bright. ☀️**
We’ll soon be powering our communities with energy from the sun and wind. Self-driving cars will get us around town at the click of a button. Delivery drones will move around tools, medicine, and packages without an operator.
And guess what?
The sun doesn’t charge us an energy bill. Autonomous cars and drones don’t ask for a wage and work 24/7.
We’re on the cusp of an economic revolution.

NestEgg empowers the true sharing economy, built bottom-up by locals building autonomous infrastructure in their communities, so that they own access to it.
In aggregate, the individual builds of these local communities will be creating a global network of energy, mobility, and access. Improving the quality of life for their communities and generations to come.


## Problem 
Organizing crowds to share an asset that benefits all of them, overcoming the obstacle of trust and administration.


## Why use Blockchain?
It provides transparency in the administration of each asset, which builds trust in the administration system. Through this we can also provide immutable stability and soverignty to the users, in which these tools continue to exist and function even if NestEgg the company no longer exists.

## Accomplishments / Experiment Status
We've current running our 2nd experiment: [**the lockbox**](http://lockbox.nestegg.eu). In this experiment, we have 20+ participants sharing a VR arcade which they helped crowdfund. Owners of this VR arcade have free access, using an IOT bluetooth smart lock which recognizes the blockchain for ownership validation before unlocking. Non-owners can pay to open the lock, of which the funds are distributed to the owners.

Previously, we launched an earlier experiment where a group of individuals shared access to [a fleet of drones](https://medium.com/nestegg/droneshare-in-review-d9bf4dcc8052).


## What Success Looks Like
Individuals can take ownership of their city by investing in new infrastructure that provides for their basic needs. By reducing the cost of living, these tools provide a means to improve the quality of life of yourself and the community you stand for, for generations to come.

## The Technology Used 
We're launching on public ethereum, yet currently building using the Rinkeby testnet. We're currently designing smart contract templates for launching unique crowdfunds for each infrastructure, and administration thereafter. 



?> Our MVP tech is almost ready. We're currently planning several pilots to launch this platform with several paying customers. If you have any enthusiasts who want to be the first to collectively deploy solar panels, have them get in touch via 💌 [info@nestegg.eu](mailto: info@nestegg.eu)
