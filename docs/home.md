## ðŸ‘‹ Howdy!
We're APG. The largest pension company in the Netherlands! ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

When it comes to delivering financial security for your future, we're the biggest nerds around. ðŸ¤“ That's why we're so enthusiastic about the possibilities of Blockchain, AI, and Climate Change. These technologies and global challenges keep us up at night because they provide a glimpse how the future of our society and economy might shape itself. 

Thus, we've pulled up our bootstraps and took the plunge. We work within the GroeiFabriek ("Growth Factory" in Dutch), which is our accellerator to deploy experiments that let us directly apply this technology to the problems in pensions. We have teams working on a variety of pilots and regularly share our knowledge with the wider ecosystem to help everyone get a better grip on how to use these tools.
