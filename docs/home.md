# GroeiFabriek Pension Blockchain Community

## Welcome
APG, the largest pension company in the Netherlands, researches and experiments with disruptive technology such as Blockchain, AI, and Climate Change solutions. Dealing with the future is APG's expertise, thus it makes strategic sense to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to technology that will fundamentally how the future will be built.

## A Community

This is a movement. 

To showcase a new culture of soverignty and spotlight exciting initiatives. 

We have these tools laying at our feet that are capable of building the infrastructure to transition our hometowns into smart-cities. We're the dreamers of utopia who picked up the wrench and got to work. We don't need to ask permission, anyone can rally a community and begin building the infrastructure of abundance and hyper-opportunity. When one of us succeeds, it inspires the next to copy and paste with their own local flair. By solving problems locally, we get tangible experience and become experts and knowledge leaders of this evolution. 

## Our Swarmwise Strategy

In aggregate, no problem is outside our scope. When someone discovers a solution locally, anyone across the world can copy/paste. This means solutions discovered at the local level can be copy/pasted infinitely as it scales across the world, creating global macro-effects.


## Our First Goal

To begin this next industrial revolution, we'll first need a new energy source. One that's accessible everywhere. ðŸŒ¤

Luckily the sun and wind don't charge an energy bill, it's free to anyone with solar panels and windmills. This empowers local communities to be energy independent, not reliant on outside institutions to maintain reliable power to their community.

To show the world we mean business, let's tackle the one everyone complains about: global warming ðŸ¤¯

While we begin to deploy the initial energy infrastructure for our industrial revolution, we'll simultaneously remove dependence from carbon based fuels, making it obselete. We figure out how to quickly deploy panels in our communities, and copy/paste the best solutions across the world.

But this is just the first step. Once we have an abundant energy source, we'll begin deploying new infrastructure powered by this free energy.

## Pre-Requsites

This next industrial revolution relies heavily on cutting edge technology to deliver a radically improved standard of living. The core of these technologies are: 

	ðŸ¤– IoT to efficiently move the real world around us (think delivery drones)
	ðŸ§  AI to coordinate massive data coming in from these devices and make smart decisions
	â›“ Blockchain to coordinate the software transparently and securely.

This repository will help you learn the underlying technology so you can begin deploying critical infrastructure in your hometown that progresses this evolution across the world.
