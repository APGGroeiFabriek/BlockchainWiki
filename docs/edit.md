# Edit this Wiki

## An Open Respository

The APG Blockchain Wiki is designed to be an open resource for the wider Pension Blockchain Ecosystem. We value the opportunity that comes with collaboration and thus allow and encourage anyone to propose edits to maintain and update this knowledge base.

All of the content on this knowledge base is stored as a markdown (.md) file on the APG GroeiFabriek‚Äôs Github. We use Github to administrate the proposals to edit the Wiki and to keep track of the history of edits.
