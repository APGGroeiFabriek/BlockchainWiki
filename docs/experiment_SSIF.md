## The Problem

Currently, individuals can‚Äôt effectively control or use their personal information on the internet. The other problem is that businesses don't have good mechanisms to verify identity claims.

## The Solution
Create an identity framework that:
* That enables individuals to create and control their digital identity. The identity framework is available for people, for organisations and for ‚Äòthings‚Äô. The Self-sovereign Identity can be used in electronic transactions with governments, businesses or other people.
* That enables organisations to specify and implement decentralised IT solutions (e.g. apps) for electronic business transactions and to create, control and use identities and personal information in a way similar to that of individuals.

## The Project

## Status
We're currently working on two experiments:

account, etc.). <br>

2. CZ (Health insurer): significantly improve declaration process of customers‚Äô
health expenses through the use of digital attestations. Experiment with issuing
‚Äúde pil‚Äù. Status: prototype being built. Preparing for a pilot to start in Jan. 2019.
