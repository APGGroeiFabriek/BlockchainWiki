## The Problem

Currently, individuals can’t effectively control or use their personal information on the internet. The other problem is that businesses don't have good mechanisms to verify identity claims.

## The Solution
Create an identity framework that:
* That enables individuals to create and control their digital identity. The identity framework is available for people, for organisations and for ‘things’. The Self-sovereign Identity can be used in electronic transactions with governments, businesses or other people.
* That enables organisations to specify and implement decentralised IT solutions (e.g. apps) for electronic business transactions and to create, control and use identities and personal information in a way similar to that of individuals.

## The Project
